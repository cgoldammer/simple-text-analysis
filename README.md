The goal is to write a package to simplify text analysis with python. 
This should include both feature extraction and building predictive models.

The package isnâ€™t yet functional, but will be functional soon. The proposed syntax is as follows. Assume that you also have a vector of outcomes. To obtain a predictive bag-of-words model from the text, you write 

```python
from text_model_functions import TextModel
modules='bag-of-words'
text_model=TextModel(outcomes,texts,modules)
```

If you want to know the outcome for some new text, you write

```python
text_model.predict("Some new text")
```
        
The package also contains additional feature extractors, for instance emotions (positive/negative and subjective/objective) and named entities (people and organizations). To extract these as well, you would write:
        
```python
modules=['bag-of-words','emotions','entities']
text_model=TextModel(outcomes,texts,modules)
```

The package does the text cleaning for you. But you can also change default options, for instance by setting:
        
```python
options={'lowercase':True,'lemmatize':True}
text_model=TextModel(outcomes,texts,modules,options)
```

Simplifying the model this far does of course require making lots of assumptions
along the way. If you want to, you should be able change these defaults one-by-one.
